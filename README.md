## Introduction
Come2Top operates as a decentralized, permissionless, fully on-chain, and peer-to-peer financial investing protocol. It employs a completely random process to distribute accumulated rewards from a farming campaign among investors. Unlike other reward distribution protocols, such as PoolTogether, where assets are locked until a winner is declared, Come2Top allows contributors to participate and withdraw their assets after the gameâ€™s lock period ends. By connecting to robust and trusted farming campaigns with a well-defined strategy, Come2Top offers a secure investment platform.


## important points
**Due to time constraints, fuzzy and functional tests are currently not available, although the system's operation has been ensured.**
 
**To quickly and accurately demonstrate performance under test conditions on the test network, the game concludes after an hour, unlike the mainnet system where the maximum duration is approximately 6 hours. As a result, all eligible participants can claim their base investment and saved amounts. Instead of the standard 30-day lock period required in the mainnet to ensure profitable performance and sufficient farming, the testnet awards approximately 1% profit to winners every hour.**
 
***Under these conditions, participants who do not win might experience a slight loss in their initial investment. However, in the mainnet, this potential loss is minimal and close to zero.***
